+ This [book](https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/ds3/), by Maarten van Steen, provides an amenable introduction to the field of distributed systems, covering, in Chapter 4, particularly, transient (MPI, for instance) and persistent (as the message-queuing systems) communication middlewares. 
+ The Chapter 3 of this [book](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~peter/ipp2/index.html), on the other hand, by Peter Pacheco, introduces sympatically the idyiossincrasies of parallel programming in distributed systems; emphatically, it explicitly distinguishes the inconveniences tied to the distribution of processes across multiple machines.
